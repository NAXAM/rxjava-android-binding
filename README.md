# RxJava: Reactive Extensions for the JVM in XAMARIN

RxJava is a Java VM implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It extends the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.

#### Version 1.x ([Javadoc](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/1.x/javadoc/))

Looking for version 1.x? Jump [to the 1.x branch](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/1.x).

Timeline plans for the 1.x line:

  - **June 1, 2017** - feature freeze (no new operators), only bugfixes
  - **March 31, 2018** - end of life, no further development
